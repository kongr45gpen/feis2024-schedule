    title: "Keynote Lecture 2: Slava Turyshev (NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory) \\\\  Multipixel Imaging and Spectroscopy of Exoplanets — A Search for Life with the Solar Gravitational Lens"
    description: The Solar Gravitational Lens (SGL) is a natural phenomenon caused by the Sun's gravitational field bending and focusing light, as predicted by general relativity. This effect provides extraordinary light amplification and angular resolution, enabling detailed imaging and spectroscopy of faint targets. A modest telescope positioned in SGL's focal region, beginning at $\sim$548 AU, could exploit it to achieve high-resolution imaging of exoplanets. This presentation discusses SGL's properties and introduces a mission concept enabled by solar sail propulsion. Sailcraft technologies are expected to allow heliocentric velocities of 20–25 AU/year within 5–7 years, enabling practical missions within two decades.
    #Current materials can allow sailcraft to achieve heliocentric velocities of up to 7 AU/year, expected to increase to 20–25 AU/year within 5–7 years, enabling practical missions within two decades.

    title: "Keynote Lecture 3: Richard A.\\ Norte (Delft University of Technology) \\\\ Propelling Interstellar Exploration: Extreme-Aspect-Ratio Metamaterials in a Post-Moore Era"
    description: "For the past half century, Moore's Law has steered the course of nanotechnology, propelling miniaturization in all 3 dimensions. As we approach its limits, our lab is exploring a new kind of nanotechnology that extends to large distances in the $X$ and $Y$ axes while remaining nanoscale in $Z$. The unique properties of these extreme-aspect-ratio metamaterials can advance applications such as missions that aim to reach Alpha Centauri in 20 years, instead of the 10\\,000 years possible today. This talk will examine opportunities arising from the integration of advanced nanofabrication and high-power optomechanical experiments, as well as our efforts to use lightsail materails to stably levitate objects over 100\\,000 times more massive than anything levitated with laser light to date."

    image: keynote3.png
    description: We present the study of the communication system designed to transmit data from an ultralight sail on an interplanetary mission. By estimating parameters such as divergence and power required, we arrive at the dimensioning of the transmitter, achieved with phased-array grating couplers. Some implementation models and the optimal error-correction code for these devices are presented. By drawing inspiration from Quantum Communication in space, the preparation of the pulses can also provide significant metrological information for studying the kinematics of solar sails.

    title: "Keynote Lecture 5: Martin Tajmar (TU Dresden) \\\\  Overview of Breakthrough Propulsion at TU Dresden"
    description: Human exploration to the stars will require a breakthrough in propulsion. We therefore decided to establish a dedicated breakthrough propulsion group within our institute to investigate and test new ideas for propellantless propulsion. Our main focus is developing a cutting-edge suite of measurement devices including thrust balances with (sub) nano-Newton resolution and a superconducting levitation thrust stand as well as a nano-gram weight balance. Several tests were carried out to test claims of revolutionary propulsion devices such as the EMDrive that could be traced back to setup-related artefacts. Here we review our program goals and developments and show some examples of what we tested so far as well as what we want to do in the future.

    description: Over the last several years, significant progress has been made on the understanding of the requirements for design of laser-driven lightsails suitable for interstellar missions. Nanophotonic design principles can enable self-stabilizing optical manipulation, levitation and propulsion of ultralight microscopic and macroscopic-sized (i.e., micron, mm, cm, or even meter-scale) metasurface lightsails via radiation pressure from a high power density pump laser source. I will discuss new simulations and measurements to test the stringent criteria for metasurface lightsail design, dynamical and opto-mechanical stability, and thermal management.
