    description: Over the last several years, significant progress has been made on the understanding of the requirements for design of laser-driven lightsails suitable for interstellar missions. Nanophotonic design principles can enable self-stabilizing optical manipulation, levitation and propulsion of ultralight microscopic and macroscopic-sized (i.e., micron, mm, cm, or even meter-scale) metasurface lightsails via radiation pressure from a high power density pump laser source. I will discuss new simulations and measurements to test the stringent criteria for metasurface lightsail design, dynamical and opto-mechanical stability, and thermal management.

Atwater's scientific effort focuses on nanophotonic light-matter interactions. He was an early pioneer in nanophotonics and plasmonics and gave a name to the field of plasmonics in 2001. Atwater's work spans fundamental nanophotonic phenomena and applications, including active wavefront shaping of light using metasurfaces, optical propulsion of lightsails, quantum and 2D nanophotonics as well as solar energy conversion, on earth and in space.

    title: "Keynote Lecture 3: Paolo Villoresi (University of Padova) \\\\  Harnessing the light emission for extreme space optical communication"
    image: keynote3.png
    description: We present the study of the communication system designed to transmit data from an ultralight sail on an interplanetary mission. Starting with the estimation of parameters such as divergence and power required, we arrive at the dimensioning of the transmission system. This is achieved with phased-array grating couplers. Some implementation models for these devices are presented. Finally, the optimal error-correction code for this type of communication has been worked out and will be briefly presented. By drawing inspiration from the methods of Quantum Communication in space, the preparation of the pulses required for communication from the sail can also provide significant metrological information for studying the kinematics of solar sails.

  AT8ECC: # Martin Tajmar
    title: "Keynote Lecture 4: Martin Tajmar (TU Dresden) \\\\  Overview of Breakthrough Propulsion at TU Dresden"
    description: Human exploration to the stars will require a breakthrough in propulsion. We therefore decided to establish a dedicated breakthrough propulsion group within our institute to investigate and test new ideas for propellantless propulsion. Our main focus is developing a cutting-edge suite of measurement devices including thrust balances with (sub) nano-Newton resolution and a superconducting levitation thrust stand as well as a nano-gram weight balance. Several tests were carried out to test claims of revolutionary propulsion devices such as the EMDrive that could be traced back to setup-related artefacts. Here we review our program goals and developments and show some examples of what we tested so far as well as what we want to do in the future.

      - biography: Prof. Dr. Martin Tajmar studied physics, space studies and electrical engineering, graduating with a PhD from TU Wien. After research stays at NASA JPL and ESA-ESTEC, he joined the Austrian Institute of Technology where he was head of the business unit ``Space Propulsion & Advanced Concepts''. After being appointed as associate professor at KAIST, he moved to TU Dresden as full professor and head of the chair of space systems in 2012, where he later became the director of the Institute of Aerospace Engineering.

Despite our efforts, unexpected challenges are inevitable during long-duration interstellar missions. This raises a crucial question: How can we adapt clinical research to develop a more responsive and resilient healthcare infrastructure for interstellar ventures? This presentation will explore innovative methodological approaches that could enhance our preparedness for interstellar travel, based on insights from a series of MetaFuturism Lab workshops." # using an interdisciplinary and multicultural methodology."
